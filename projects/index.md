The Albrecht lab is at the forefront of pioneering large field studies on citrus trunk injection. Our research has shown promising results in mitigating the negative effects of HLB. One of the key findings from the Albrecht lab is that trunk injections of OTC has resulted in a substantial reduction in fruit drop and a significant increase in overall yield. These injections have also demonstrated a remarkable improvement in the fruit's internal and external quality. By leading these studies on citrus trunk injection, we are trying to advance the understanding of effective strategies to manage HLB and enhance citrus fruit quality and productivity.

With Dr. Albrecht's expertise and the lab's multidisciplinary approach we aim to contribute valuable insights into plant physiology, improve crop productivity, and develop sustainable solutions for the challenges faced by growers in the agricultural industry.
