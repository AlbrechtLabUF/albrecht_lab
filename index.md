# Welcome to the Albrecht Lab

We are a group of scientists and researchers at the University of Florida's Southwest Research and Education Center [(SWFREC)](https://swfrec.ifas.ufl.edu/) located in sunny south Florida and the heart of Florida citrus production. Our research focuses on citrus rootstocks, root system architecture, and trunk injection therapies for citrus greening.
